## Issues Found

### Navigation
- [ ] Issue #1: [iPhone SE/Android] [touch-target] Hamburger button touch target may be < 48px (p-2 padding with 24px icon = ~40px total)
  → Fix: Change p-2 to p-3 or add min-h-[48px] min-w-[48px] to button at line 226-236
- [ ] Issue #2: [All mobile] [typography] Logo text may be too small for easy tapping (text-xl = 20px)

### HeroSection
- [ ] Issue #3: [iPhone SE/Android] [typography] Headline may be too small on very small screens (text-4xl = 36px)
  → Fix: Already using responsive text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-[72px] - GOOD but could add min-text-[32px] for consistency
